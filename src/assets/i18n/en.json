    "Objective": "This model provides a universal framework for organizations to calculate their greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint. The application is built on the basis of the GHG footprint calculation model of the Ministry of Climate. More information about the use of this model can be found at: https://kliimaministeerium.ee/organisatsioonide-khg-jalajalg"

  "PageInfo": {
    "OrganizationWhy": "The first step is defining the time period (year) for which the GHG footprint is to be calculated. In addition, the scope of the organization (structural units, departments, etc.) is defined, whose GHG footprint will be evaluated.",
    "M1Info": "Scope 1 (M1). Includes the organization's direct GHG emissions from the organization's own activities/emission sources. The model enables the calculation of GHG emissions from the following activities/emission sources:",
    "M1Energy": "- The organization's own energy production (M1-Energy);",
    "M1Vehicles": "- GHG emissions resulting from the use of the organization's own vehicles (M1-Vehicles);",
    "M1Dispersed": "- Diffuse emissions generated by the organization's equipment (M1-Diffuse emissions).,",
    "M2Info": "Scope 2 (M2). Indirect GHG emissions resulting from the consumption of energy purchased from other organizations:",
    "M2ElectricalEnergy": " ̶ Indirect GHG emissions resulting from the production of electricity purchased by the organization (M2-Purchased electricity)",
    "M2HeatEnergy": " ̶   Indirect GHG emissions resulting from the production of thermal energy purchased by the organization (M2-Purchased thermal energy)",
    "M3Info": "Scope 3 (M3). Other indirect emissions that are caused by the activities, products and services of the organization (except the consumption of purchased electricity, heat and cooling energy, i.e. impact area 2 emissions), but whose GHG emission sources are not owned or controlled by the organization assessing the GHG footprint.",
    "M3Transport": " ̶  Indirect GHG emissions resulting from transport services outsourced from other organizations (M3-Transport)",
    "M3BusinessTrips": " ̶ Indirect GHG emissions resulting from work trips of the organization's personnel (M3-Work trips)",
    "M3WorkHome": " ̶ Indirect GHG emissions resulting from the movement of the organization's personnel to work and home (M3-Work-home)",
    "M3HomeOffice": " ̶ Indirect GHG emissions of the home office of the organization's staff (M3-Home office)",
    "M3Products": " ̶ Indirect GHG emissions resulting from purchased and sold products (input and output) (M3-Purchased products and M3-Sold products)",
    "M3Investments": " ̶ Indirect GHG emissions related to financial investments (M3-Financial investments)",
    "M3Diffuse": " ̶ Upstream indirect GHG emissions of vehicle fuels (resulting from raw fuel extraction, refining and transport)",
    "M3Waste": " ̶ Diffuse emissions of the organization's supply chain (M3-Diffuse emissions)"
